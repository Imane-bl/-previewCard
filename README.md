###HTML File: Contains a structure with a <div> element having a class of content.
Inside this div, there are various elements like images (img), buttons (button),
headings (h1, h3), and paragraphs (p).

###CSS File (styles.css): Defines the visual appearance and layout of elements.

##Key CSS Styling:
Reset: Resets margins, paddings, and box-sizing for all elements to ensure a consistent base style.
Variables: Defines custom CSS variables for colors, allowing for easy color management throughout the stylesheet.
Body Styles: Sets the background color, font family, and line height for the entire page.
Content Container: Styles the container (div.content) with a white background, border radius, box shadow, and other properties for a card-like appearance.
Image Styles: Defines specific styles for images like width, height, margin, and border radius.
Button Styles: Styles buttons with custom colors, border-radius, and hover effects.

###Responsive Design:
Media Queries: Uses media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.
For small screens (phones), the layout is modified to accommodate the smaller viewport by adjusting widths, margins, and font sizes.
For tablets and medium-sized screens, the content's width and image sizes are scaled accordingly for better display.
A specific media query seems to target screens with a maximum width of 768px, possibly addressing smaller tablets or specific mobile devices.
For larger screens (desktops), the default styles (460px width for the content and 400px width for images) are maintained.
The project demonstrates a structured approach to styling content, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout 
across various devices through the use of responsive design techniques.
